Harbor Simple Router
====================

Provides an NGINX image with predefined templates, controlled by environment variables.

Based on Harbor's concept - an external gateway with service discovery is routing traffic to containers by domain name,
simple router does not replace gateway, it should be put in place of application container to eg. do rewrites, redirects, proxying etc.

Example architecture
--------------------

Gateway + Service Discovery routes traffic to selected container by hostname -> Simple Router reacts for eg. forum.zsp.net.pl and performs redirection to super-hiper-new-forum.zsp.net.pl

#### Configuration reference

List of all common environment variables and their defaults. Those variables are used regardless of template.

```yaml
{% for env_var, attrs in DOCKERFILE_ENVS.items() %}{% if attrs[2] %}# {{ attrs[2] }}{% endif %}
- {{ attrs[0] }} # (default: {{ attrs[1] }})

{% endfor %}
```
